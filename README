Some dirty integration of WS2812FX (based on Adafruit Neopixel) for the SK6812 RGBW leds.

USE:

- Install Adafruit Neopixel (from the lib manager)
- Install ArduinoJSON (from the lib manager)
- Install PubSubClient (from the lib manager)
- Install WS2812FX (from a zip download on github)
- Create a config.h file from the example with your own information


TODO:
- Make White work
- Make OTA work
