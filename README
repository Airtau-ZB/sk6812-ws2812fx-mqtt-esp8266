Some dirty integration of WS2812FX (based on Adafruit Neopixel) for the SK6812 RGBW leds.

USE:

- Install Adafruit Neopixel (from the lib manager)
- Install ArduinoJSON (from the lib manager)
- Install ArduinoOTA (from the lib manager)
- Install PubSubClient (from the lib manager)
- Install WS2812FX (from a zip download on github)
- Create a config.h file from the example with your own information
- Integrate configuration.yaml into your Home Assistant config


TODO:
- Use setSegment() and multiple colors
- Get rid of the String with some char
- Add HA switch to reset colors to 0 so we can have white only (not possible using the default color wheel on HA)
- ...
