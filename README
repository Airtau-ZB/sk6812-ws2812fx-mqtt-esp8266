Some dirty integration of WS2812FX (based on Adafruit Neopixel) for the SK6812 RGBW leds.

USE:

- Install Adafruit Neopixel (from the lib manager)
- Install ArduinoJSON (from the lib manager)
- Install ArduinoOTA (from the lib manager)
- Install PubSubClient (from the lib manager)
- Install WS2812FX (from a zip download on github)
- Create a config.h file from the example with your own information
- Integrate configuration.yaml into your Home Assistant config

NOTE:
If you're using WS2812 LED strip, you should probably set white_value to false
on HA configuration. Hopefully the Arduino code should work.

TODO:
- Use setSegment() and multiple colors
- Get rid of the String with some char
- Add HA switch to reset colors to 0 so we can have white only
  (not possible using the default color wheel on HA)
- Sometimes the code crashed and restarts the ESP. It's possible it's a bug
  when it cycles to the white led (for instance when using a random color
  effect), and that it's a WS2812FX bug. But it's not sure it actually reboots
  because sendState() is not called.
